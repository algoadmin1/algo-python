## TODO Items for the Botti Bros

# Will:  
#	add 3 day pivots, add simple graph. Fix current pivots to show YESTERDAY if we are actively trading, and also show the 'active' pivots intraday, but properly annotated
#	Create diagram of 'computer assisted improvisation' AI product.  The market for AI-assisted music composition is still wide open, relative to other areas
#	

# John: 
#	visit Twin and Nephews in NC. Trust the process. LEVEL BLEST will cover half of ALL expenses incurred in trip, as a minimum.
#	Continue boxing and coding up the autobot

# Diego: 
#	Start learning UE 5.3 - we need tutors + he can help on UE 5 promotional materials and plumbing with the new 'ai-assisted production techstack'

# Matteo:
